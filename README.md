# Sensitive Canary

[![CI](https://github.com/coo-quack/sensitive-canary/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/coo-quack/sensitive-canary/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A security plugin that prevents unintended data leaks from Claude Code. Automatically detects and blocks secrets — in prompts, file reads, and command executions — before they are sent to the Anthropic API.

No proxy server. No background process. Native Claude Code hooks only.

## About this fork

This is [gladstomych](https://github.com/gladstomych)'s **secrets-only** fork of
[coo-quack/sensitive-canary](https://github.com/coo-quack/sensitive-canary),
tuned for context hygiene: block what would echo real secrets into the
conversation, never block scripts that merely *use* credentials. Differences
from upstream:

- **All PII rules removed** (email, US/JP phone, SSN, credit card, JP postal,
  private IPv4). They flagged routine dev data far more often than real leaks.
  The `[allow-pii]`/`[mask-pii]` tag plumbing remains for compatibility.
- **`$VAR` env-value checks apply only to `echo`/`printf` segments**, so
  `curl -H "x: $TOKEN"` and `API_KEY=$KEY python app.py` pass; `echo $TOKEN`
  still blocks.
- **Bash command text skips the generic `env-assignment`/`generic-secret`
  rules** (they fire on grep patterns and `TOKEN=$(...)` captures) and skips
  connection strings whose credentialed URLs all point at
  `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`. Specific token formats still block everywhere.
- **`.env.example`/`.env.sample`/`.env.template` skip the `.env` name block**;
  their contents are still scanned.
- File contents read into the conversation keep the full secret rule set.

Install this fork (the repo is its own marketplace):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add gladstomych/sensitive-canary
claude plugin install sensitive-canary@gladstomych
```

The rest of this README is upstream documentation; PII-related passages
describe rules this fork does not ship.

## Why sensitive-canary?

Claude Code is a powerful development tool, but file reads and command executions can inadvertently send secrets and personal information to the Anthropic API. API keys in `.env` files, tokens embedded in config files, credentials pasted into the terminal — once sent to the API, they leave your machine.

**sensitive-canary intercepts them before they are sent, preventing unintended data leaks.**

| Without sensitive-canary | With sensitive-canary |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| `cat .env` → full contents sent to Claude ❌ | Blocked by name before Claude reads it ✅ |
| Paste `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` in prompt ❌ | Blocked before the API call is made ✅ |
| `echo $API_KEY` with live key ❌ | Env var value scanned and blocked ✅ |

- **Two hooks** — `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` cover both directions of risk
- **24 detection rules** (secrets only in this fork) — sourced from gitleaks and TruffleHog detector definitions
- **Entropy filtering** — reduces false positives on low-entropy values
- **Luhn validation** — credit card numbers are validated, not just pattern-matched
- **Local only** — all scanning runs in your terminal; nothing is sent anywhere

---

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js **22.6.0** or later (required for `--experimental-strip-types`)
- Claude Code 1.0.33 or later

### Plugin install (recommended)

Install in two commands from inside a Claude Code session:

**1. Register the marketplace** (this repo is its own marketplace)

```
/plugin marketplace add gladstomych/sensitive-canary
```

**2. Install the plugin**

```
/plugin install sensitive-canary@gladstomych
```

Done. The hooks are enabled automatically.

To install the original instead, use upstream's marketplace:
`/plugin marketplace add coo-quack/claude-code-marketplace` then
`/plugin install sensitive-canary@coo-quack`.

> **Keeping up to date:** Third-party marketplaces have auto-update disabled by default. To receive automatic updates, run `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** tab → select the marketplace → **Enable auto-update**. You can also update manually from the same tab. See [Discover and install plugins](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/discover-plugins) for details.

<details>
<summary>npm install</summary>

> **Note:** the npm package is upstream's build and does not include this
> fork's changes. Prefer the plugin install above.

Install locally via npm and configure hooks manually:

```bash
npm install -g @coo-quack/sensitive-canary
```

Update to the latest version:

```bash
npm update -g @coo-quack/sensitive-canary
```

Then add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx tsx $(npm root -g)/@coo-quack/sensitive-canary/src/user-prompt-submit-hook.ts"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Read|Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx tsx $(npm root -g)/@coo-quack/sensitive-canary/src/pre-tool-use-hook.ts"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Node.js does not support `--experimental-strip-types` for files inside `node_modules`, so `npx tsx` is used instead.

```bash
cd ~/sensitive-canary && git pull
```

Then add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node --experimental-strip-types ~/sensitive-canary/src/user-prompt-submit-hook.ts"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Read|Bash",

## What Happens

### Prompt blocked

Prompts containing secrets or PII are blocked before being sent.

```
> My AWS key is AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE. Can you review this code?

🐤  sensitive-canary: sensitive data detected — blocked

  [Secret] AWS Access Key ID (aws-access-key): AKIA****MPLE

To allow, add a tag to your prompt:
  [allow-secret]  — allow secrets
  [allow-all]     — bypass all sensitive-canary checks
```

To allow it through, add the suggested tag:

```
> [allow-secret] My AWS key is AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE. Can you review this code?
```

### .env file blocked

`.env` / `.env.*` files are blocked unconditionally, regardless of their contents.

```
> Read .env

🐤 sensitive-canary: blocked — /path/to/.env

🚫 Blocked: .env and .env.* files contain secrets and must not be read into the conversation.

To allow this, the user must add an allow tag to their next prompt:
  [allow-secret]  — allow secrets
  [allow-pii]     — allow PII
  [allow-all]     — bypass all sensitive-canary checks

Example: "[allow-secret] please read /path/to/.env"
```

### File content blocked

Non-`.env` files are also blocked if their contents contain secrets or PII.

```
> Read config.yaml

🐤 sensitive-canary: blocked — /path/to/config.yaml

🚫 Blocked: file contains sensitive data

  [Secret] AWS Access Key ID (aws-access-key): AKIA****MPLE
```

### Allow tags

To intentionally bypass a block, include the appropriate tag in your **current prompt**.

| Tag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `[allow-secret]` | Skip all secret-category checks |
| `[allow-pii]` | Skip all PII-category checks |
| `[allow-all]` | Skip all sensitive-canary checks |

> **Note:** Tags are read from the **current user message only**. Tags in previous messages are ignored — there is no risk of an accidental persistent bypass. Tags are case-insensitive. `[allow-secret]` does not bypass PII blocks (and vice versa). The name-based block on `.env`/`.env.*` files can be bypassed by any of the three allow tags.

### PII (removed in this fork)

Upstream ships 7 PII rules (email, credit card, SSN, US/JP phone, JP postal,
private IPv4). This fork removes all of them; see "About this fork" above.

Detection patterns are based on rule definitions from [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) and [TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog).

## How It Works

### ① UserPromptSubmit hook

Runs just before a prompt is sent to the API.

```
User presses Enter
      ↓
UserPromptSubmit hook
      ↓ scans prompt
      ├─ secret / PII detected AND no matching [allow-xxx] tag → block (exit 2)
      └─ nothing detected OR tag present → pass (exit 0)
```

When blocked, the terminal shows what was detected and how to bypass it.

### ② PreToolUse hook

Runs just before Claude calls the `Read` or `Bash` tool.

```
Claude calls Read / Bash tool
      ↓
PreToolUse hook
      ↓
      ── Read tool ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      │  1. filename is .env / .env.* → blocked unconditionally
      │  2. file contents contain secret / PII → blocked
      └─ Bash tool ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
         1. env var values referenced in the command contain secret / PII → blocked
         2. command string itself contains secret / PII (e.g. echo AKIA...) → blocked
         3. cat / head / tail / etc. targeting a file → file contents scanned
```

When blocked, Claude receives a JSON response explaining the reason and is prompted to tell the user.
The terminal also receives a direct message (via `/dev/tty`).

---

## Allow Tags (detailed)

Allow tags filter the scan results — the scan itself always runs. The `.env`/`.env.*` name block is the only exception: when an allow tag is present, the file is passed through immediately without scanning.

### Mask tags

`[mask-secret]`, `[mask-pii]`, and `[mask-all]` are recognised but **not supported**. Claude Code hooks cannot rewrite prompt content, so masking before sending is not possible.

If you include a mask tag, sensitive-canary will explain this and list what was detected:

```
> [mask-secret] My key is AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE, can you review this?

🐦 sensitive-canary: prompt masking is not supported

  [mask-secret] cannot mask prompt content.
  The following sensitive data was detected:

  [Secret] AWS Access Key ID (aws-access-key): AKIA****MPLE

  Please choose one of the following:

  1. Manually redact the values above and resubmit
  2. To send as-is, add an allow tag to your prompt:
       [allow-secret]  — allow secrets
       [allow-all]     — bypass all sensitive-canary checks
```

### Allow + Mask tag priority

When both `[allow-*]` and `[mask-*]` tags appear in the same prompt, **the tag that appears first wins** for each category (`secret`, `pii`). `[allow-all]` and `[mask-all]` resolve both categories at once.

| Example | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `[allow-secret] [mask-secret] …` | secret allowed |
| `[mask-secret] [allow-secret] …` | masking not supported error |
| `[allow-secret] [mask-pii] …` | secret allowed, PII mask error |
